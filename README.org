All external dependency sources are explicitly included under the ~elpa/~
directory, meaning it's as simple as "clone-n-go".  Opening this document under
my configuration looks like so:

* Goals
I use Emacs 28+ all three of the major platforms, in both GUI and TTY mode.  So
this config is designed to work equally well for:

|----------+----------+-----+-----------+-------|
| platform | terminal | GUI | ssh + TTY | Tramp |
|----------+----------+-----+-----------+-------|
| Linux    | ✅       | ✅  | ✅        | ✅    |
| macOS    | ✅       | ✅  | ✅        | ✅    |
| Windows  | ❌       | ✅  | ❌        | ✅    |
|----------+----------+-----+-----------+-------|

Once I figure out how to get colors working in Windows terminal, I'll update
this table.  For now though, the 16 bit colors don't react to my color theme,
and so on Windows I rely singularly on GUI mode, rather than WSL or emacs inside
Alacritty.

If I had to sum up the theme of my configuration, it would be "vanilla extract".
In only a few instances do I change overt behavior of Emacs, the most noticiable
departures of course being the color theme, vertico minibuffer, and [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][corfu]]
completion-at-point.  Even with those, though, I want a configuration that fits
my hands in such a way that I remain comfortable using =emacs -Q= with very little
disruption to my normal muscle memory and workflow.

I do make changes to things that I feel "should have been included."  Some
examples of this are:

1. Additional major modes for languages like Markdown, go, and rust
2. Error message support for =pyright= in a =*Compilation*= buffer
3. Reasonable indentation behavior for SQL files
4. Updating buffers automatically if their contents change on disk
5. Syntax highlighting for Source blocks in Markdown.


You may notice that despite the laudable goal of intended minimalism, this
document is is still quite long, as I have found many (ever increasing) quirky
behaviors of Emacs that I tweak.  Most of my time is spent in Org, SQL, Python,
Bash, and Markdown, so the majority of configuration lies around these sections.

* Tangling
My configuration is a single literate programming document, which is tangled
into the standard =init.el= and supporting files.  This is so I can keep track of
all the crazy things I try, and explain them inline with the final code I decide
to include.  Some platforms like GitHub can render this document in a limited
way, but to see all the final configuration values I use you will likely have to
view this document in Emacs itself.

Why use a literate document for my configuration?  Basically, as I added more
comments and reminders about what some line of code was doing, where I got it
from, and why it might be commented out, the prose grew longer than the actual
code, and so a change of medium felt prudent.  In my case, that's the venerable
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], which comes with Emacs and serves as a way to seamlessly weave
commentary and code together.

* Inspirations
Here's where I put the typical quote about standing on one form of shoulders or
another.  I steal quite a lot from other, more qualified Emacs community
contributors, such as:

- [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos Stavrou]]
- [[https://panadestein.github.io/emacsd/][Ramón Panadestein]]
- [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/][Mickey Petersen]]
- [[https://github.com/minad][Daniel Mendler]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin][Omar Antolín Camarena]]

* Header
To comply with the Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Headers.html][conventions for libraries]], the tangled init.el must
have the following header and [[Footer][footer:]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; Keywords: internal

;;; Code:
#+end_src

* Custom
I prefer having custom modify its own file.  This next snippet ensures any
=package-install= or =custom= edits go to =custom.el=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file 'noerror))
#+end_src

* Packages
The initial cornerstone of every Emacs configuration is a decision on package
management and configuration.  I opt for =use-package= and =package.el=, since both
are built-in to Emacs 29+, which helps maximize stability and portability.

To avoid loading packages twice, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Package-Installation.html][the manual]] recommends disabling
~package-enable-at-startup~ in ~init.el~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
#+end_src

MELPA (Milypostman's Emacs Lisp Package Archive) is the largest repository for
elisp sources that aren't a part of the official GNU ELPA.  To install packages
from it, we need it on the =package-archives= list.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+end_src

I do not use the =:ensure t= keyword in =use-package= declarations to install
packages.  Instead, I rely on =M-x package-install= and =M-x package-delete=, and
only permit =use-package= to handle the configuration and loading of packages.  As
mentioned in the introduction, each package's source is explicitly included into
version control of my configuration, so I don't worry too much about pinning
package versions in this file.  When I want to update a package, I use =M-x
package-update=, the =package.el= user interface, or delete the package's source
folder and use =renz/package-sync= (defined below).  Should something go wrong, I
roll back to a previous commit.  So far, this method has been reliable for
keeping my =init.el= (this README), =custom.el=, the =package-selected-packages=
variable, and =elpa/= directory all in sync with one another.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun renz/package-sync ()
  "Remove unused sources and install any missing ones"
  (interactive)
  (package-autoremove)
  (package-install-selected-packages))
#+end_src

There are also a few hand-made packages I keep around in a special
~.emacs.d/site-lisp~ directory.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "site-lisp/" user-emacs-directory))
#+end_src

* OS-specific Configuration

** Microsoft Windows

Windows, funnily enough, has some trouble registering the Windows key as a
usable modifier for Emacs.  In fact, =s-l= will /never/ be an option, since it's
handled at the hardware level.  I also add a few nice-to-haves, like setting the
default shell to ~pwsh~ and explicitly pathing out ~aspell~, which I always install
with ~msys64~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun renz/windowsp ()
  "Are we on Microsoft Windows?"
  (memq system-type '(windows-nt cygwin ms-dos)))

(when (renz/windowsp)
  ;; Set a better font on Windows
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Hack NF-12")

  ;; Alternate ispell when we've got msys on Windows
  (setq ispell-program-name "aspell.exe")

  ;; Set default shell to pwsh
  (setq explicit-shell-file-name "pwsh")
  )
#+end_src

For a time I considered enabling the use of the winkey like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
(setq w32-pass-lwindow-to-system nil)
(setq w32-lwindow-modifier 'super) ; Left Windows key
(setq w32-pass-rwindow-to-system nil)
(setq w32-rwindow-modifier 'super) ; Right Windows key
#+end_src

Followed by enabling specific chords, such as "winkey+a":

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
(w32-register-hot-key [s-a])
#+end_src

Since I've taken a more TTY-friendly approach for my config in general, where
super can be a bit tough to integrate with both the windowing application /and/
the terminal emulator, I've mostly given up on the GUI key in favor of other
chords, especially the =C-c= ones.

** macOS
Launching Emacs from the typical application launcher or command-space usually
won't capture any modifications to =$PATH=, typically handled in a file like
=~/.profile= or =~/.bashrc=. So, the main configuration included here is from
[[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  ;; Uncomment this if we can't install Hack Nerd font
  ;; (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Menlo-14")
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Hack Nerd Font Mono-13")
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+end_src

** Linux
Very little to do here.  Emacs on Linux seems to "just work".  When I have the
Hack font installed, I sometimes turn it on by manually evaluating this block,
though.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Hack Nerd Font Mono-11")
#+end_src

* Theme: ~ef-themes~
[[https://protesilaos.com/][Prot's]] themes have been reliably legible in nearly every situation.  Now with
his new [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes][ef-themes]], they're pretty, too! The =ef-themes-headings= variable creates
larger, bolder headings when in [[Org-mode]], and ~ef-themes-to-toggle~ allows me to
quickly switch between preset light and dark themes depending on the ambient
light of the room I'm in.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ef-themes
  :demand t
  :bind ("C-c m" . ef-themes-toggle)

  :init
  (setq ef-themes-headings
        '((0 . (1.9))
          (1 . (1.8))
          (2 . (1.7))
          (3 . (1.6))
          (4 . (1.5))
          (5 . (1.4)) ; absence of weight means `bold'
          (6 . (1.3))
          (7 . (1.2))
          (t . (1.1))))
  (setq ef-themes-to-toggle '(ef-cherie ef-summer))

  :config
  (load-theme 'ef-cherie :no-confirm))
#+end_src

I LOVE these themes from =ef-themes=:

 * *Light*
   + =ef-frost=
   + =ef-light=
   + =ef-summer=
 * *Dark*
   + =ef-cherie=
   + =ef-trio-dark=
   + =ef-winter=

I've mostly settled on ~ef-cherie~, but sometimes switch to the others above.

** Gave up on Nord
It's worth mentioning that I've tried [[https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/emacs/][nord-theme]] a couple times and found that
the legibility or contrast wasn't quite good enough in some modes.  Though I
still employ Nord for my terminal config in Alacritty and Kitty, where it looks
/excellent/.  I also still actively use the [[https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim][nordfox]] theme in Neovim, which sports
a beautiful TreeSitter integration.

** Messed up colors in TTY mode
In TTY mode, I use [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty]].  I have had trouble with dark blue or red themes in
Alacritty, and on Windows terminal.  There is probably some hacking I could do
on my ~$TERM~ variable to try and sort that out, but since it just kinda works in
Kitty for me, I haven't spent too much time looking into it.

* Emacs' Built-in Settings
My settings for base Emacs.  Assuming I ran with /no/ plugins (ala ~emacs -Q~), I
would still set most of these by hand at one point or another.

** Mode line
It's easy for the mode line to get cluttered once things like Flymake and eglot
kick in.  When I was starting out, I used to have these two settings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
(setq display-battery-mode t
      display-time-day-and-date t)

(display-time)
#+end_src

After a while I noticed that I'm almost never running Emacs in a full screen
where I can't see the battery or date in the corner of my window manager, so
they were just wasting mode line space.  Nowadays I simply opt for column mode
and a dimmed mode line in non-selected windows.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq column-number-mode t
      mode-line-in-non-selected-windows t)
#+end_src

** =eldoc=
I find it very distracting when =eldoc= suddenly pops up and consumes a large part
of the screen for docstrings in python.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p nil)
#+end_src

** COMMENT Remember minibuffer history
Found this on a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51eSeqcaikM][System Crafters video]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq history-length 25)
(savehist-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Colored output in ~eshell~
Copy-pasted from a [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/9517/colored-git-output-in-eshell][stack overflow question]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'eshell-preoutput-filter-functions  'ansi-color-apply)
#+end_src

** Recent files menu
This enables "File -> Open Recent" from the menu bar, and ~consult-recent-file~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(recentf-mode t)
#+end_src

** Fill-column
Regardless of whether we're doing visual fill or hard fill, I like the default
at around 80 characters, and I'll manually change it per buffer if I want
something different

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default fill-column 80)
#+end_src

** Scroll bar
I toggle this one on/off sometimes depending on how I feel and which OS I'm
currently on.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

** Window margins and fringe
This hunk adds some space around all sides of each window so that we get a clear
space between the edge of the screen and the fringe.  This helps ~src~ blocks look
clean and well delineated for [[=org-modern=][org-modern]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(modify-all-frames-parameters
 '((right-divider-width . 40)
   (internal-border-width . 40)))

(dolist (face '(window-divider
                window-divider-first-pixel
                window-divider-last-pixel))
  (face-spec-reset-face face)
  (set-face-foreground face (face-attribute 'default :background)))

(set-face-background 'fringe (face-attribute 'default :background))
#+end_src

** Automatically visit symlink sources
When navigating to a file that is a symlink, this automatically redirects us to
the source file it's pointing to.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq find-file-visit-truename t)
(setq vc-follow-symlinks t)
#+end_src

** Indent with spaces by default
For the most part I edit Python, SQL, Markdown, Org, and shell scripts.  All of
these favor spaces over tabs, so I prefer this as the default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
#+end_src

** Render ASCII color escape codes
For files containing color escape codes, this provides a way to render the
colors in-buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun renz/display-ansi-colors ()
  (interactive)
  (require 'ansi-color)
  (ansi-color-apply-on-region (point-min) (point-max)))
#+end_src

** Enable horizontal scrolling with mouse
From a helpful [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/67758169][stackoverflow answer.]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq mouse-wheel-tilt-scroll t)
#+end_src

** Window management
From a Mickey Petersen [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager][article]], this causes ~switch-to-buffer~ to open the
selected buffer in the current window rather than switching windows, assuming
both are open in the current frame.  This is more frequently the behavior I
intend when I'm trying to get a window to display a specific buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless (version< emacs-version "27.1")
  (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t))
#+end_src

** Automatically update buffers when contents change on disk
Without setting ~global-auto-revert-mode~, we have to remember to issue a
~revert-buffer~ or ~revert-buffer-quick~ (=C-x x g= by default) in case a file
changed.  Over Tramp, we still have to manually revert files when they've
changed on disk.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-auto-revert-mode)
#+end_src

** Highlight the line point is on
Add a faint background highlight to the line we're editing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode)
#+end_src

** Stop stupid bell
This snippet has a special place in my heart, because it was the first two lines
of elisp I wrote when first learning Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Stop stupid bell
(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
#+end_src

The bell is really, /really/ annoying.

** Automatically create matching parens in programming modes

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (electric-pair-mode t))
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (show-paren-mode t))
#+end_src

** Delete whitespace on save
I would also like to have a good-looking display for trailing whitespace and
leading tabs like in my Neovim setup, but it has proven challenging to just
narrow down to those two faces.  In the interim, I toggle ~M-x whitespace-mode~ to
check for mixed tabs, spaces, and line endings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
#+end_src

** Don't wrap lines

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default truncate-lines t)
(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook (toggle-truncate-lines nil))
#+end_src

** Relative line numbers
For programming and prose/writing modes.

Unfortunately, line numbers are displayed in the text area of the buffer, but
org-modern uses the fringe to display source blocks.  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ymprwi/comment/iv5iafb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][There's no way to display
them to the left]] of the fringe, so I'm careful about only turning on line
numbers in modes that I think I'll benefit from it.  It's been working pretty
well in org-mode without the line numbers so far, since for each of the code
blocks I can always use =C-c '= to edit in ~prog-mode~, where I /do/ get line numbers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (setq display-line-numbers 'relative)))
(add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook (lambda () (setq display-line-numbers 'relative)))
(unless (display-graphic-p)
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (setq display-line-numbers 'relative))))
#+end_src

** Delete region when we yank on top of it
I just think that's a funny sentence.  Normally when yanking text with an active
region, the region will remain and the yanked text is just inserted at point.  I
prefer the modern word processor behavior of replacing the selected text with
the yanked content.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(delete-selection-mode t)
#+end_src

** Enable mouse in terminal/TTY

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(xterm-mouse-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Compilation
As new text appears, the default behavior is for it to spill off the bottom
where we can't see it.  Instead, I prefer the window to scroll along with text
as it appears

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq compilation-scroll-output t)
#+end_src

Enable colors in the =*compilation*= buffer.  Provided by a [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/3072831/13215205][helpful stackoverflow
answer]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun renz/colorize-compilation-buffer ()
  "Enable colors in the *compilation* buffer."
  (require 'ansi-color)
  (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
    (ansi-color-apply-on-region (point-min) (point-max))))

(add-hook 'compilation-filter-hook 'renz/colorize-compilation-buffer)
#+end_src

** Tool bar
I usually leave the tool bar disabled

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(tool-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

The /menu/ bar, on the other hand =(menu-bar-mode)=, is very handy, and I don't
think I'll ever disable it.

** Ignore risky .dir-locals.el
From an [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/44604][Emacs stackexchange]] answer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(advice-add 'risky-local-variable-p :override #'ignore)
#+end_src

** Prefer =rg= and =fd= over =grep= and =find=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (executable-find "rg")
  (setq grep-program "rg"))

(when (executable-find "fd")
  (setq find-program "fd"))
#+end_src

** Confirm when exiting Emacs
It's very annoying when I'm working and suddenly I meant to do ~C-c C-x~, but
instead hit ~C-x C-c~.  This helps prevent that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq confirm-kill-emacs 'yes-or-no-p)
#+end_src

** Smooth scrolling
Emacs 29 introduced smooth, pixel-level scrolling, which removes much of the
"jumpiness" you see when scrolling past images.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(if (version< emacs-version "29.0")
    (pixel-scroll-mode)
  (pixel-scroll-precision-mode 1)
  (setq pixel-scroll-precision-large-scroll-height 35.0))
#+end_src

** Prefer ~aspell~ over ~ispell~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (executable-find "aspell")
  (setq ispell-program-name "aspell"))
#+end_src

** Backup and auto-save files
Keep all backup files in a temporary folder.  At the moment I have some "file
not found" errors popping up during auto-save on Windows.  Once I debug that,
I'll uncomment the second part.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq backup-directory-alist
      '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups/"))
      ;; auto-save-file-name-transforms
      ;; '(("." ,temporary-file-directory t))
      )
#+end_src

** Enable ~narrow-to-region~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(put 'narrow-to-region 'disabled nil)
#+end_src

** Enable up/downcase-region

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(put 'upcase-region 'disabled nil)
(put 'downcase-region 'disabled nil)
#+end_src

* Keybindings
Eventually, some of the custom functions that I bound to convenient keys had a
logical abstraction, which I extract and put up here for them to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun renz/--jump-section (dirname prompt extension)
  "For internal use: prompt for a file under `dirname' in the user
emacs config site with matching `extension' regexp"
  (find-file
   (concat dirname
	   (completing-read prompt
			    (directory-files dirname nil extension)))))
#+end_src

** Expanded/better defaults
These convenient chords allow for fast text replacement by holding =C-M-= and
rapidly typing =k= and =h= in succession.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-<backspace>") 'backward-kill-sexp)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-h") 'backward-kill-sexp)
#+end_src

The next line UNBINDS the suspend-frame keybinding.  Accidentally minimizing on
the GUI was frustrating as hell, so now I use =C-x C-z= if I /really/ want to
suspend the frame.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-z") #'zap-up-to-char)
#+end_src

Hippie-expand [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/text-expansion-hippie-expand][is purported]] to be a better version of ~dabbrev~, but I rather like
the default behavior of ~dabbrev~.  I typically have ~hippie-expand~ on a dedicated
key, and sometimes re-bind the default =M-/= as well, depending on my current
workflow.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [remap dabbrev-expand] 'hippie-expand)
#+end_src

~ibuffer~ is a strictly superior, built-in version of its counterpart.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [remap list-buffers] 'ibuffer)
#+end_src

The most common situation where I'm running ~flymake~ would be for spelling in
prose, or diagnostics from a language server.  In either case, I like having
next/previous on easy to reach chords.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package flymake
  :bind (:map flymake-mode-map
         ("M-n" . flymake-goto-next-error)
         ("M-p" . flymake-goto-prev-error)))
#+end_src

When using ~isearch~ to jump to things, it's sometimes convenient to re-position
point on the opposite side of where the search would normally put it.  E.g. when
using =C-r=, but we want point to be at the end of the word when we're done.
Provided by a [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/52554][stack overflow answer]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>")
  (defun isearch-done-opposite (&optional nopush edit)
    "End current search in the opposite side of the match."

** Overriding defaults
Some default bindings aren't useful for me, so I bind them to actions I take
more frequently.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-p") 'previous-buffer)  ; Overrides `mark-page'
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-n") 'next-buffer)      ; Overrides `set-goal-column'
#+end_src

** C-c bindings
Emacs has [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Key-Bindings.html][some standards]] about where user-configured keys should go; =C-c
<letter>= is always free for users.  It may seem like overkill how I set a header
for each possible =C-c= combination, but it's incredibly handy when I want to jump
directly to one of these headings while in another buffer.  See
e.g. =renz/jump-init=, which allows me to narrow in on a particular key I'd like
to bind by leveraging =completing-read=.  If a =C-c <letter>= combination is missing
as a header, then I'm probably using it in a ~:bind~ statement with ~use-package~
somewhere else.

** F5-F9
Like the =C-c <letter>= bindings, these are reserved for users.  In practice, even
though there are few of these keys, I tend to forget which is which.  So I wind
up using things bound to my =C-c= keymaps instead.  The =C-c= kyes from a more
natural, nested language in my head, so it feels more like I'm "speaking Emacs"
that way.

* Autocompletion
Emacs offers incredible depth and freedom when configuring methods that
automatically complete text.  There are actually two things that
"autocompletion" can refer to in Emacs:

1. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Completion.html][Minibuffer completion]]
2. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion-in-Buffers.html][Completion at point]]

Emacs on its own does not have a nice pop-up-menu like Vim for completing text
at point.  For both the minibuffer and ~completion-at-point~ it uses a special
buffer called ~*Completions*~, from which we can see (and optionally select) a
completion from potential candidates.  Before we get to tweak those settings,
though, we first need to oil the engine with an enhanced /completion style/

** Completion style: Orderless
For both the minibuffer and ~completion-at-point~, I use the same /completion
style/.  Completion style is the method of assigning completion candidates to a
given input string.  ~flex~ is the built-in "fuzzy" completion style, familiar to
us from symbol completion in IDEs and VSCode's command palette.  ~basic~ functions
much like your default TAB-complete at a Bash shell.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq completion-styles '(flex basic partial-completion emacs22))
#+end_src

I've found the [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]] completion style especially well-suited to Emacs.  It
allows me to type short strings that can match the symbol I'm looking for in any
order.  In Emacs, I may not know if I'm looking for ~package-list~ or
~list-packages~.  In either case, I can just type "=pack lis=" in the minibuffer to
find the correct one.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package orderless
  :config
  (add-to-list 'completion-styles 'orderless)

  :custom
  (completion-category-overrides '((file (styles basic partial-completion)))))
#+end_src

** COMMENT Nicer Display and Behavior of ~*Completions*~
With the /completion style/ set, we now have to configure the interface for
/displaying/ candidates as we type.  First, I want candidates displayed as a
single, vertical list.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq completions-format 'one-column)
#+end_src

Also, when using the built-in completion-at-point, the ~*Completions*~ buffer can
sometimes take up the whole screen when there are a lot of candidates.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless (version< emacs-version "29.0")
  (setq completions-max-height 15))
#+end_src

Some time ago, Prot wrote a package called [[https://github.com/protesilaos/mct/blob/main/mct.el][MCT]] (Minibuffer and Completions in
Tandem) that enhanced the default minibuffer and ~*Completions*~ buffer behavior
to act more like what we expect of a modern editor's auto-complete.  He
discontinued development of that project once it became clear that Emacs 29 was
going to include similar behavior as a configurable option.  These are the
options in question.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless (version< emacs-version "29.0")
  (setq completion-auto-help 'visible
        completion-auto-select 'second-tab
        completion-show-help nil
        completions-sort nil
        completions-header-format nil))
#+end_src

Another nice addition to Emacs 29 is the option to sort completion candidates
with any supplied function.  Below is one example provided by Prot, which
prioritzes history, followed by lexicographical order, then length.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun renz/sort-by-alpha-length (elems)
  "Sort ELEMS first alphabetically, then by length."
  (sort elems (lambda (c1 c2)
                (or (string-version-lessp c1 c2)
                    (< (length c1) (length c2))))))

(defun renz/sort-by-history (elems)
  "Sort ELEMS by minibuffer history.
Use `mct-sort-sort-by-alpha-length' if no history is available."
  (if-let ((hist (and (not (eq minibuffer-history-variable t))
                      (symbol-value minibuffer-history-variable))))
      (minibuffer--sort-by-position hist elems)
    (renz/sort-by-alpha-length elems)))

(defun renz/completion-category ()
  "Return completion category."
  (when-let ((window (active-minibuffer-window)))
    (with-current-buffer (window-buffer window)
      (completion-metadata-get
       (completion-metadata (buffer-substring-no-properties
                             (minibuffer-prompt-end)
                             (max (minibuffer-prompt-end) (point)))
                            minibuffer-completion-table
                            minibuffer-completion-predicate)
       'category))))

(defun renz/sort-multi-category (elems)
  "Sort ELEMS per completion category."
  (pcase (renz/completion-category)
    ('nil elems) ; no sorting
    ('kill-ring elems)
    ('project-file (renz/sort-by-alpha-length elems))
    (_ (renz/sort-by-history elems))))

(unless (version< emacs-version "29.0")
  (setq completions-sort #'renz/sort-multi-category))
#+end_src

Ideally, I would have a function that prioritizes based on /relevance/, which is
not always a trivial algorithm.

What all of the above form isn't /quite/ the live-updating version that [[https://github.com/oantolin/live-completions][Oantolnin]],
MCT, or vertico offer, but it's pretty close.  The ~*Completions*~ buffer updates
after every ~<SPC>~, which is the natural filtering mechanism for =orderless=.

** COMMENT Completion at point
By default, Emacs uses =M-TAB=, or the equivalent =C-M-i= for ~completion-at-point~.
I'd much prefer to use the easier and more intuitive =TAB=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
#+end_src

Again, we set ~C-n~ and ~C-p~ when completion-in-region is active for selecting
candidates.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless (version< emacs-version "29.0")
  (define-key completion-in-region-mode-map (kbd "C-p") #'minibuffer-previous-completion)
  (define-key completion-in-region-mode-map (kbd "C-n") #'minibuffer-next-completion))
#+end_src

** Minibuffer completion with vertico

[[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] is lightning quick, and has intuitive keybindings that don’t require any
futzing. Especially in the case where I’m looking to tab-complete things like
C-x C-f /ssh:<thing>.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package vertico
  :config
  (vertico-mode)
  (vertico-buffer-mode -1)
  (define-key vertico-map "\M-q" #'vertico-quick-insert)
  (define-key vertico-map "\C-q" #'vertico-quick-exit)

  (vertico-multiform-mode)
  (setq vertico-multiform-categories
        '((consult-grep buffer))))
#+end_src

Combining vertico’s forces with [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]] creates a lovely minibuffer
completion experience that rivals (or even beats) modern IDE and VSCode command
palettes. marginalia adds a short, context-aware description next to completion
candidates in the minibuffer. For instance, using C-h f will show me if a
function is already bound to a key, and give me the top-level description of the
function, without requiring me to actually open the *Help* buffer.

** corfu
For completion-at-point suggestions, I like [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][corfu]] a lot. It’s philosophy is to
stick as close as possible to the native Emacs internal API as possible, without
reinventing the wheel. In my experience, this has meant far fewer integration
troubles with other packages. It uses child frames for displaying the completion
candidates, however, which means we need a separate corfu-terminal extension for
it to work in TTY mode. While use-package has the :unless and :if keywords, I
seem to have trouble getting them to actually work with display-graphic-p, and
the official instructions with window-system wasn’t working for me. Hence, it’s
wrapped in an unless block.

I’ve also enabled the TNG (Tab-n-go) style of completion, as laid out in corfu’s
[[https://github.com/minad/corfu#tab-and-go-completion][README]].  In ~comint-mode~, we switch to manual completion (instead of
autocomplete), since eager buffering of candidates can cause freezes or
stuttering in large directories, like ~/usr/bin~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package corfu-terminal
  :unless (display-graphic-p)
  :config
  (corfu-terminal-mode +1))

(use-package corfu
  :demand t

      ;; (setq-local corfu-auto nil) ;; Enable/disable auto completion

* Tramp
Tramp (Transparent Remote Access Multiple Protocol) allows us to access files on
a remote machine, and edit them locally.  This is great for simple changes or
quickly testing out some Python on a VM somewhere.  It isn't as snappy as using
the TTY version or an X-forwarded Emacs from the server directly, so if I /can/
set up Emacs remotely, I usually do.  When I don't want to or don't have the
time, Tramp is a godsend.  There are, however, many foibles to guard against,
particularly with how interacts with version control and ~.dir-locals~.  The
Tramp manual (distributed with Emacs) recommends adjusting these for some speed
improvements:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package tramp
  :defer t
  :config
  (setq vc-handled-backends '(Git)
        file-name-inhibit-locks t
        tramp-inline-compress-start-size 1000
        tramp-copy-size-limit 10000
        tramp-verbose 1)
  (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path 'tramp-own-remote-path))
#+end_src

eglot is [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/859][actively working]] on an issue related to timers causing a "Forbidden
reentrant call of Tramp" message and freezing.  In the meantime, this setting
was recommended.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq tramp-use-ssh-controlmaster-options nil)
#+end_src

For some time I was having a lot of trouble with prohibitive slowness over
Tramp, and after careful scrutiny of the logs on (I believe) =tramp-verbose 6=, I
found out that enabling remote dir-locals was causing a huge bottleneck.  On
every operation it would trace up the filesystem tree back to the root
directory, scanning for a ~.dir-locals~ file.  Since some of the drives were
network-mounted, this caused thousands of network calls per file operation,
obviously slowing things down a lot.  Because of this, I've opted to simply
disable ~.dir-locals~ over Tramp entirely, since I don't really use it much, if at
all.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
;; (setq enable-remote-dir-locals t)
#+end_src

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Frequently-Asked-Questions.html][Disabling VC]] /does/ seem to speed things up a little, but it's not an acceptable
thing to put in, since I so frequently use VC over tramp.  Fully disabling VC
would include this snippet:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
(remove-hook 'find-file-hook 'vc-find-file-hook)

(setq vc-ignore-dir-regexp
      (format "\\(%s\\)\\|\\(%s\\)"
              vc-ignore-dir-regexp
              tramp-file-name-regexp))
#+end_src

Additionally, these came up as other potential options [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/3909][from the doom-emacs
issues]], which I do not currently include.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
(setq tramp-default-method "scp")
(setq projectile--mode-line "Projectile")
#+end_src

I often need to set these in ~/.ssh/config for TRAMP to speed up

#+begin_example
Host *
     ControlMaster auto
     ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%h:%p
     ControlPersist 10m
     ForwardAgent yes
     ServerAliveInterval 60
#+end_example

* TreeSitter
Emacs 29 added native [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][TreeSitter]] support.  TreeSitter is a new way of
incrementally parsing source code that offers superior navigation and syntax
highlighting.  To fully realize this benefit, however, it requires that we
install =tree-sitter= grammars independently from Emacs.  Right now, I'm using
[[https://github.com/casouri/tree-sitter-module][casouri's modules]], which I build and install under =~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter=, if
they don't already exist under =/usr/local/lib/= or =~/.local/lib=.

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:casouri/tree-sitter-module.git
cd tree-sitter-module
./batch.sh
mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter
cp ./dist/* ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter/
#+end_src

In case of the latter, I just add extra paths to =treesit-extra-load-path=
explicitly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (boundp 'treesit-extra-load-path)
  (add-to-list 'treesit-extra-load-path "/usr/local/lib/")

For the full instructions, the commit history of adding the =tree-sitter= modules
to Emacs included a [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/plain/admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide?h=feature/tree-sitter][full guide]], which can be read in Info under "Parsing Program

Enabling TreeSitter is done on a per-language basis to override the default
major mode with the corresponding TreeSitter version.

I use =consult-org-heading= for jumping between headers now, so I no longer tangle
this line into my config.

~org-mode~ provides =org-babel-tangle-jump-to-org=, which jumps back to an Org
source file from within the tangled code.  ~renz/org-babel-tangle-jump-to-src~,
defined below, does the opposite - given the Org source file and point inside a
~src~ block, it jumps to the location of the tangled code.  Provided by a helpful

Now we configure ~org-mode~ itself.  For a while I was trying =(setq
org-startup-indented t)= t get indentation under each header, but this was
interfering with the beautification features from ~org-modern~.  Preferring the
latter over the former, I've removed the =org-startup-indented= call.

**** TODO sql-formatter
I've modified [[https://github.com/purcell/sqlformat][sqlformat]] for use with [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-formatter][sql-formatter]], but I need to find a way to
pass in a JSON of configuration values to the command line interface when we
call it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package sqlformat
  :after (sql))
#+end_src

When I get to it, I think what I'll do instead is rewrite this to simply pipe
the current buffer into ~sql-formatter~, and use a bit of elisp to determine whether
a ~.sql-formatter-config.json~ exists in the VC root directory.

** Python

The =M-x compile= feature does not recognize or parse ~pyright~ error messages out
of the box, so I add that support myself.  Here's an example error message:

#+begin_example
/home/robb/tmp/errors.py/
  /home/robb/tmp/errors.py:1:1 - error: "foo" is not defined (reportUndefinedVariable)
  /home/robb/tmp/errors.py:1:1 - warning: Expression value is unused (reportUnusedExpression)
  /home/robb/tmp/errors.py:4:12 - error: Operator "+" not supported for types "str" and "Literal[1]"
    Operator "+" not supported for types "str" and "Literal[1]" (reportGeneralTypeIssues)
2 errors, 1 warning, 0 informations
#+end_example

To get the basic =M-g M-n= and =M-g M-p= navigation working, we just need a regex to
parse file name, line, and column number.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'compile
  (add-to-list 'compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist
               '(pyright "^[[:blank:]]+\\(.+\\):\\([0-9]+\\):\\([0-9]+\\).*$" 1 2 3))
  (add-to-list 'compilation-error-regexp-alist 'pyright))
#+end_src

It would be nice if we could also capture the =\\(error\\|warning\\)= part as
"KIND", but I'm struggling to get it working.

Another nice vanilla feature of ~python-mode~ is =M-x python-check=, which runs a
pre-specified linter.  Setting that to ~mypy~ or ~pyright~ if either of those
programs exist is a small time saver.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package python
  :config
  (if (executable-find "mypy")
      (setq python-check-command "mypy"))
  (if (executable-find "pyright")
      (setq python-check-command "pyright"))
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'blacken-mode))
#+end_src

At one point, I ran into something similar to this [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/issues/733][elpy issue]] on Windows.  The
culprit was "App Execution Aliases" with python and python3 redirecting to the
windows store.  Using this fixed it:

#+begin_example
     winkey -> Manage app execution aliases -> uncheck python and python3
#+end_example

Also on Windows - a =pip install= of =pyreadline3= is required to make
tab-completion work at all. It provides the =readline= import symbol.

Virtualenvs require ~.dir-locals.el~ to have something like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
((python-mode . ((python-shell-virtualenv-root . "/path/to/my/.venv"))))
#+end_src

However, this only operates on `run-python' shells.  Also, for projects, we need to
make sure that setting the virtualenv root is marked as safe.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(put 'python-check-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp)
(put 'python-shell-virtualenv-root 'safe-local-variable #'stringp)
#+end_src

Eventually, I would like to try the [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter][emacs-jupyter]] package to interface with
Jupyter kernels from org-mode.

*** pyrightconfig.json

The most consistent way to get =eglot= to properly configure the python virtual
environment with =pyright= is to have a static file at the root of the project,
called ~pyrightconfig.json~.  I wrote a short plugin that allows me to select a
directory using =completing-read= and have Emacs write the content of
~pyrightconfig.json~ based on what I selected, in the appropriate directory.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package pyrightconfig
  :after (python))
#+end_src

Configuring pyright this way rather than "activating" an environment through
Emacs (ala =pythonic-activate= or similar) means we can be running the language
server in more than one project at a time, each pointing to its respective
virtual environment.

*** blacken
Formatting a buffer with =black= has never been easier!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package blacken
  :bind ("C-c p" . blacken-mode)
  :after (python))
#+end_src

** Markdown
Some folks like to write markdown without hard line breaks.  When viewing those
documents, I can use ~M-x renz/md-hook~ to view it as if there were line breaks in
it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun renz/md-hook ()
  "View buffer in visual fill mode with 80 character width."
  (interactive)
  (visual-fill-column-mode)
  (setq-local fill-column 80))
#+end_src

=poly-markdown-mode= enables syntax highlighting within code fences for markdown.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package poly-markdown
  :after (markdown-mode)
  :mode ("\\.md" . poly-markdown-mode))
#+end_src

** AutoHotkey

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ahk-mode
  :mode "\\.ahk\\'")
#+end_src

** csv-mode
Handy for viewing data quickly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package csv-mode
  :mode "\\.csv\\'")
#+end_src

* Small tool configuration
These are tweaks for both third party packages and those bundled with emacs that
require little configuration and don't warrant a top-level header.

** COMMENT Git gutter
Shows a little icon outside the fringe when working version has changes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package git-gutter
  :demand t
  :bind ("C-c v s" . git-gutter:stage-hunk)
  :config (global-git-gutter-mode))
#+end_src

** ~dabbrev~: swap ~M-/~ and ~C-M-/~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dabbrev
  ;; Swap M-/ and C-M-/
  :bind (("M-/" . dabbrev-completion)
         ("C-M-/" . dabbrev-expand))
  ;; Other useful Dabbrev configurations.
  :custom
  (dabbrev-ignored-buffer-regexps '("\\.\\(?:pdf\\|jpe?g\\|png\\)\\'")))
  #+end_src


** dired
By default, ~dired~ uses bytes instead of "K", "Mb", or "G" for file sizes.  I
also have it hide the mode, size, and owner of each file by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dired
  :hook (dired-mode . dired-hide-details-mode)
  :config
  (setq dired-listing-switches "-alFh")
  (setq dired-dwim-target t))
#+end_src

Also enabled above is Do-What-I-Mean (DWIM) copying.  This is for when two dired
windows are open, and we want to copy something from one location to the other.
By enabling ~dired-dwim-target~, it auto-populates the minibuffer with the other
dired window's path when issuing a copy command with ~C~.

** Embark
https://github.com/oantolin/embark

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package embark
  :bind
  (("C-." . embark-act)
   ("C-\\" . embark-dwim)
   ("C-h B" . embark-bindings))

  :init
  ;; Optionally replace the key help with a completing-read interface
  ;; (setq prefix-help-command #'embark-prefix-help-command)

  :config
  ;; Hide the mode line of the Embark live/completions buffers
  (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
               '("\\`\\*Embark Collect \\(Live\\|Completions\\)\\*"
                 nil
                 (window-parameters (mode-line-format . none)))))


(use-package embark-consult
  :hook
  (embark-collect-mode . consult-preview-at-point-mode))
#+end_src

** Coterm mode
Adds the ability to use TUI programs in shell mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package coterm
  :unless (renz/windowsp)
  :config
  (coterm-mode))
#+end_src

** Visual fill column
For visual lines, this adds line breaks at the fill-column value.  Especially
useful for prose that is meant to be copied to other mediums, such as email or
word.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package visual-fill-column
  :config
  (add-hook 'visual-line-mode-hook #'visual-fill-column-mode))
#+end_src

** Magit
The one and only.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package magit
  :bind ("C-c g" . magit-status))
#+end_src

As a reminder - when using pre-commit hooks it may take a while for the hooks to
install.  Magit will asynchronously kick off that process, and we can check on
it with =$=.  The built-in `vc` is /synchronous/, and will block Emacs entirely
until it's done.  So some of the performance hit from using Magit is well worth
it in situations like that.

** Change or copy inner/outer

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package change-inner
  :bind (("C-c c i" . change-inner)
         ("C-c c o" . change-outer)
         ("C-c y i" . copy-inner)
         ("C-c y o" . copy-outer)))
#+end_src

** eww - search engine and browser

Ecosia requires JavaScript, unfortunately.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package eww
  :config
  (setq eww-search-prefix "https://duckduckgo.com/html/?q="))
#+end_src

** change-inner
Modeled after Vim's =ci=, =ca=, =yi=, and =ya= commands, these let us yank or kill text
within a "surrounding" delimiter, such as "" or ().

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package change-inner
  :bind (("C-c c i" . change-inner)
         ("C-c c o" . change-outer)
         ("C-c y i" . yank-inner)
         ("C-c y o" . yank-outer)))
#+end_src

** Esup: startup time profiling
[[https://github.com/jschaf/esup][esup]] is a tool for profiling the startup time of Emacs.  This snippet is a work
around of a bug where esup tries to step into the byte-compiled version of
`cl-lib', and fails horribly: https://github.com/jschaf/esup/issues/85

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package esup
  :bind ("C-c x p")
  :config
  (setq esup-depth 0))
#+end_src

** Reloading Emacs
Often used when changing up my ~init.el~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package restart-emacs
  :bind ("C-c x r" . restart-emacs))
#+end_src

** Language Server Protocol (LSP) with ~eglot~
As of version 29, [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] (Emacs polyGLOT) is bundled with Emacs.  It provides Emacs with the
client side configuration for the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][language server protocol]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package eglot
  :bind (("C-c l c" . eglot-reconnect)
         ("C-c l d" . flymake-show-buffer-diagnostics)
         ("C-c l f f" . eglot-format)
         ("C-c l f b" . eglot-format-buffer)
         ("C-c l l" . eglot)
         ("C-c l r n" . eglot-rename)
         ("C-c l s" . eglot-shutdown)))
#+end_src

To have ~eglot~ always start up for a python buffer, we would tangle this line
into ~init.el~.  However, this can cause a significant loading delay over Tramp,
and I would prefer snappy, simple access with LSP provided on an as-needed
basis.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
#+end_src

*** Side show: ~semantic-mode~
For a while, it looks like Emacs was trying out something called [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/semantic/Semantic-mode.html][semantic-mode]],
which looks a lot like a precursor to what we now know as the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][Language Server
Protocol]].  Enabling it was done through adding the ~semantic-mode~ hook to your
language's major mode hook:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval never
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'semantic-mode)
#+end_src

* Start a server for =emacsclient=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(server-start)
#+end_src
