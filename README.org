Automatically pick between TreeSitter and default major modes in Emacs 29+.

* Installation

This package is not on ELPA/MELPA yet.  To install it, you will need to copy
=treesit-auto.el= to somewhere on your =load-path=, or use the new
=package-vc-install=.

#+begin_src example
M-x package-vc-install RET https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto.git
#+end_src

Then, in your Emacs configuration file (=~/.emacs.d/init.el=),

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package treesit-auto
    :config
    (treesit-auto-apply-remap))
#+end_src

* What this package does

Emacs 29, while featuring =treesit.el= and a convenient
=treesit-install-language-grammar=, [[https://archive.casouri.cc/note/2023/tree-sitter-in-emacs-29/index.html][will not feature an intelligent way to choose]]
between a default mode, such as =python-mode=, and it's tree-sitter enhanced
version, =python-ts-mode=, automatically.  This package attempts to remedy that
by applying these rules:

*1. If the grammar is installed, then switch to the appropriate tree-sitter mode:*

In this case, assuming we open a Python buffer, and the [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python][Python tree-sitter
grammar]] is installed, then Emacs will use =python-ts-mode= instead of
=python-mode=.

*2. If the grammar is NOT installed, and the user has specified a fallback:*

This package exposes a customizable variable =treesit-auto-fallback-alist= that
lets you pick the fallback modes by name.  For instance, if we apply this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'treesit-auto-fallback-alist '(toml-ts-mode . conf-toml-mode))
#+end_src

Then, when the TOML grammar is missing, Emacs will use =conf-toml-mode=, instead
of trying to fall back to =toml-mode=.

**3. If the grammar is NOT installed and the user has NOT specified a fallback
    mode AND an appropriately named base mode exists, switch to it**

This is the most general case.  If, for example, the Go tree-sitter grammar is
not installed, but we have installed [[https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el][go-mode]], then Emacs will use that instead
of =go-ts-mode=, since they share the same =go-= prefix.

* Configuration

If you have modified =treesit-language-source-alist= through =setq=, then it is
recommended to put any configuration of this package AFTER that =setq=.

Not all default major modes make sense to bump up to a similar tree-sitter mode.
For example, when /I/ open a =.sh= file, my intent is nearly always to be using it
with Bash.  This is not the case for everyone, though, so by default this
package will not replace =sh-mode= with =bash-ts-mode=.  If you do want such a
remap, simply include a line like this before calling =treesit-auto-apply-remap=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'treesit-auto-fallback-alist '(bash-ts-mode . sh-mode))
#+end_src

If you want =treesit-auto-apply-remap= to re-run after installing a grammar with
=treesit-install-language-grammar=, try advising the function with something like
this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (advice-add 'treesit-install-language-grammar
              :after (lambda (&rest _r) (treesit-auto-apply-remap)))
#+end_src

** Keep track of your hooks

This package does not modify any of your major mode hooks.  That is, if you have
functions in =python-mode-hook=, but not in =python-ts-mode-hook=, then your hook
from =python-mode= will not be applied, assuming =python-ts-mode= is what gets
loaded.  For major modes in which this is a concern, the current recommendation
is to address this as part of your configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq python-ts-mode-hook python-mode-hook)
#+end_src

** Full example

This is how I configure =treesit-auto= for my own personal use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package treesit-auto
    :demand t
    :config
    (add-to-list 'treesit-auto-fallback-alist '(bash-ts-mode . sh-mode))
    (treesit-auto-apply-remap)
    (advice-add 'treesit-install-language-grammar
                :after (lambda (&rest _r) (treesit-auto-apply-remap))))
#+end_src
