;;; Commentary:

;; Eat's name self-explainary, it stands for "Emulate A Terminal".
;; Eat is a terminal emulator.  It can run most (if not all)
;; full-screen terminal programs, including Emacs.

;; It is pretty fast, more than three times faster than Term, despite
;; being implemented entirely in Emacs Lisp.  So fast that you can
;; comfortably run Emacs inside Eat, or even use your Emacs as a
;; terminal multiplexer.

;; It has many feature that other Emacs terminal emulator still don't
;; have, for example complete mouse support.

;; It flickers less than other Emacs terminal emulator, so you get
;; more performance and a smooth experience.

;; To start Eat, run M-x eat.  Eat has three keybinding modes:

;;   * "emacs" mode: No special keybinding, except the following:

;;       * `C-c' `C-s': Switch to semi-char mode.
;;       * `C-c' `C-j': Switch to char mode.
;;       * `C-c' `C-k': Kill process.

;;   * "semi-char" mode: Most keys are bound to send the key to the
;;     terminal, except the following keys: `C-\', `C-c', `C-x',
;;     `C-g', `C-h', `C-M-c', `C-u', `M-x', `M-:', `M-!', `M-&'.  The
;;     following special keybinding are available:

;;       * `C-q': Send next key to the terminal.
;;       * `C-y': Like `yank', but send the text to the terminal.
;;       * `M-y': Like `yank-pop', but send the text to the terminal.
;;       * `C-c' `C-k': Kill process.

;;   * "char" mode: All supported keys are bound to send the key to
;;     the terminal, except `C-M-m' or `M-RET', which is bound to
;;     switch to semi-char mode.

;; If you like Eshell, then there is a good news for you.  Eat
;; integrates with Eshell.  Eat has two global minor modes for Eshell:

;;   * `eat-eshell-visual-command-mode': Run visual commands with Eat
;;     instead of Term.

;;   * `eat-eshell-mode': Run Eat inside Eshell.  After enabling this,
;;     you can run full-screen terminal programs directly in Eshell.
;;     You have three keybinding modes here too, except that `C-c'
;;     `C-k' is not special (i.e. not bound by Eat) in "emacs" mode
;;     and "line" mode.
