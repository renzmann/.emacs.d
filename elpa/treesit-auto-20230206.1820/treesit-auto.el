  "Alist mapping tree-sitter modes to their respective fallback modes.

If the CDR of the association is nil, then no fallback will be
attempted when encountering a tree-sitter mode that is missing an
installation of its respective grammar.  If the CDR is non-nil,
then a fallback attempt is made to the specified mode.

If a tree-sitter mode is omitted from the keys of this alist
entirely, then a fallback is attempted by using the same name
prefix.  For example, `python-ts-mode' will attempt a fallback to
`python-mode'.

In any case, if the fallback mode does not exist, then no
fallback is attempted.  One example of this would be for
`go-mod-mode', which would be the automatic fallback for
`go-mod-ts-mode'.  If `go-mod-mode' isn't installed, then Emacs
will still use its default behavior of using `go-mod-ts-mode',
regardless of whether the grammar is installed or not."
