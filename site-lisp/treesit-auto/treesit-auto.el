;;; Commentary:
;; If a tree-sitter grammer is available and installed, use it instead of the

;; available and a fallback major mode is available/specified, use it instead.

  "Alist mapping treesitter modes to their respective fallback modes.
If the CDR of the association is nil, then no fallback will be
attempted when encountering a tree-sitter mode that is missing an
installation of its respecitve grammar.  If the CDR is non-nil,
then a fallback attempt is made to the specified mode.

If a treesitter mode is omitted from the keys of this alist
entirely, then a fallback is attempted by using the same name
prefix. For example, `python-ts-mode' will attempt a fallback to
`python-mode'.

In any case, if the fallback mode does not exist, then no
fallback is attempted.  One example of this would be for
`go-mod-mode', which would be the automatic fallback for
`go-mod-ts-mode'.  If `go-mod-mode' isn't installed, then Emacs
will still use its default behavior of using `go-mod-ts-mode',
regardless of whether the grammar is installed or not."
