#+TITLE: Trying to use a remote LSP in a virtual environment with Tramp

* Use an absolute file Tramp file name for the server executable
Something like ssh:machine:/path/to/venv/bin/pylsp. This can be done
by setting eglot-server-programs (you probably want to do this
dir-locally).
* Activate the venv in .profile.
If typing M-! which pylsp RET prints the right thing, then Eglot
should find the language server too.
* Customize tramp-remote-path
Include the bin directory of your venv (you probably want to use
connection-local variables for this).
* Connect to LSP over TCP
** =ssh -L XXXX:localhost:XXXX <user>@<ip>=
** Activate virtual environment on server
** =pylsp --tcp --host localhost --port XXXX=
** Start eglot on local emacs, and will ask for host and port number, then just input localhost:XXXX
* Read the Flymake manual for diagnostic viewing
